# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# I am Tereza, IT student, mainly focusing on Web Development.

My goal is to become Front-end developer and successfully graduate from IT&Economics. The reason why I am using GitHub is to map my journey from the beggining and to see the progress I'm doing.

**Iâ€™m currently working on .. improving my skills.**

I'm not working on any big project right know. Firstly I want to be more aware of the languages I'm learning and then move on some practice.

# Fun fact

I used to be more humanities and social sciences based person. I graduated from French & History. I spent 2 semesters studying French at University and then I completely switched to Tech studies & IT. You never know, where the wind blows you.
